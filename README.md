# 🧠 MiniBrain

**MiniBrain** is a personal project that explores fundamental techniques in **medical image processing** using 2D medical images (X-ray, MRI).  

The project applies filtering, segmentation, thresholding, and region-based methods to extract insights from real-world imaging data.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- scikit-image, OpenCV, matplotlib
- MedNIST Dataset (subset)

## ✨ Goals
- Practice classical image processing methods  
- Build strong foundations before transitioning to 3D/multidimensional imaging  
- Understand practical applications in healthcare

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Add feature-based classification and evaluation  
- Work with 3D and DICOM files in future versions

📂 This repo currently includes a Jupyter Notebook that documents each step in a clear and reproducible manner.
